Remarks
-------
We tried to organize the code by using a one-to-one mapping between
vm commands and asm code using Python dictionaries. The strategy was
breaking down common asm patterns into small asm code snippets, and 
using them as building blocks to construct the various functionalities
of the vm commands.
Extending project 7 presented it's challenges. It also allowed us to
notice poor desgin choices in the previous project and upgrade 
accordingly.
