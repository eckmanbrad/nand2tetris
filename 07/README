Remarks
-------
I tried to organize the code by using a one-to-one mapping between
vm commands and asm code using Python dictionaries. The strategy was
breaking down common asm patterns into small asm code snippets, and 
using them as building blocks to construct the various functionalities
of the vm commands. Hopefully in this way the expansion in project 8
will be fairly easy.
